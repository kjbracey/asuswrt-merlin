        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-07
        Reboot Required:        Yes
        Notes:                  For SOME Comcast service areas it has been seen that the
                                Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value is incorrectly set to a low
                                priority, resulting in decreased internet throughput for wireless IPv4 transfers.
                                This fix overrides that incorrect value.

        Released:               Update-11
        Reboot Required:        Yes
        Notes:                  If you are using HTTPS validation, the security certificate is regenerated at every
                                  boot, requiring you to install a new certificate in your browser.  This
                                  option saves the certificate across reboots negating the need to reinstall
                                  in your browser.

        Released:               Update-17
        Reboot Required:        No
        Notes:                  The default NAT Loopback is that developed by Merlin and has been used in all fork
                                  firmware levels which have been released.   Merlin's implementation employs
                                  iptables marks in it's implementation.   This alternate method does not use
                                  marks and may be helpful if the user is employing custom marks.   Note also
                                  that in V17 the standard Merlin implementation has been changed to only use
                                  a single bit, to aid users who what to perform custom packet marking.

        Notes:                  The base 374.43 firmware only supports the lower channels on the 5GHz band in
                                  EU configured routers.
                                This setting enables support for the DFS and upper 5GHz channels with full regulatory
                                  support.
								Note: There are two versions of the MIPS based AC66U, rev A2 and rev B0.  The DFS
                                  DFS channels are only available on the later rev B0 hardware.

Ability force a DHCPv6 request during IPv6 prefix delegation

        Can be set in gui:      Yes
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set ipv6_dhcp6c_force=1
                                nvram commit && reboot

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-19
        Reboot Required:        Yes
        Notes:                  Some ISPs will not send an IPv6 prefix without an address REQUEST.
                                  Sky UK is known to require this option.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special IPv6 options

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set ipv6_isp_opt=xx
                                nvram commit && reboot

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-20
        Reboot Required:        Yes
        Notes:                  ipv6_isp_opt is a mask with the following options
                                  ipv6_isp_opt=16 : Disable rapid-commit for dhcp6 server
                                  ipv6_isp_opt=8  : Disable rapid-commit for dhcp6c client
                                  ipv6_isp_opt=4  : Send generic ia-na=0 (default is calculated value based on MAC)
                                  ipv6_isp_opt=2  : Don't send prefix length, preferred lifetime hint (this may be invalid)
                                  ipv6_isp_opt=1  : Force default ipv6 route if not set by ISP

                                The default value is ipv6_isp_opt=0. Add the values to select multiple options.

OpenVPN Client Reverse Strict DNS

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set vpn_reverse_strict=1
                                nvram commit && reboot

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-23
        Reboot Required:        No - alternatively can restart the VPN Client
        Notes:                  The OpenVPN DNS strict option causes dnsmasq to access the DNS servers in order, first to last,
                                  with the DNS servers provided by the VPN added BEFORE the defined WAN servers.
                                Setting this option causes the VPN DNS servers to be appended to the list of servers AFTER the WAN
                                  defined servers, so they will be accessed only if the WAN defined servers are unavailable.
                                  This may be useful if you are running a DNS server on your local LAN.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Local Name Resolution

        Can be set in gui:      Yes
        Enable via NVRAM:       No
                                Enable by adding the following lines to /jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add

                                dhcp-script=/usr/sbin/v6hosts.sh
                                addn-hosts=/_etc/hosts.autov6

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-23
        Reboot Required:        No - if manually configuring restart dnsmasq
        Notes:                  Add script for IPv6 hosts auto update for native/stateless IPv6
                                  (adds local ipv6 name resolution to public address)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move certs from NVRAM to JFFS

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       No
                                This function is provided via command line using telnet/ssh

                                To move the SSH (dropbear certs), enter
                                sshd2jffs or
                                sshd2nvram
								When moving the SSH keys to jffs (sshd2jffs), the data is normally copied from the default nvram variables.
                                Using 'sshd2jffs copyall' will initialize jffs reading the data from the internal system directory and force
                                  a replacement of the keys during the next boot.

                                To move the OpenVPN certs, enter
                                ovpn2jffs  [server1|server2|client1|client2] or
                                ovpn2nvram [server1|server2|client1|client2]

                                At the end of the command execution, you will be prompted to reboot the router

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-24
        Reboot Required:        Yes
        Notes:                  These commands can free NVRAM space by moving certificates/keys from NVRAM to JFFS (and back if required).
                                They may be used if you are receiving a low NVRAM warning from the router gui.
                                IMPORTANT:  If you wish to revert to a firmware prior to Update-24 and have moved the certs to JFFS,
                                  you MUST move them back to NVRAM prior to loading the earlier firmware.

Disable ASUS Protection Server

        Can be set in gui:      Yes (Firewall)
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set ptcsrv_enable=0
                                nvram commit && service restart_firewall


        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-27
        Reboot Required:        No
        Notes:                  The ASUS protection server monitors attempts to access the telnet and SSH ports.  If excessive attempts
                                  are detected, the source IP address of those attempts will automatically be blocked.
                                It is NOT recommended to disable this service unless you are running a third-party router addon which
                                  provides the same functionality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assign Bandwidth Limiter rules in Kb/s instead of Mb/s

        Can be set in gui:      Yes (User-defined Bandwidth Limiting)
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set qos_bw_units=0

        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-27
        Reboot Required:        No
        Notes:                  Set the value to '0' for Kb/s or to '1' for Mb/s
                                followed by a refresh of the webui for Bandwidth Limiter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow blocking IPv6 when OpenVPN client is active

        Can be set in gui:      Yes (OpenVPN Client)
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set vpn_block_ipv6=1
                                nvram commit


        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-27E7
        Reboot Required:        No
        Notes:                  When running in a dual stack environment, set the value to '1' to block IPv6, or '0' to allow
                                Setting this option may create delays in opening some IPv6 enabled sites depending on the browser bein used.
                                  IPv6 only sites will not be accessible.

Do not send empty WPAD response

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set dhcpd_send_wpad=0
                                nvram commit


        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-32E6
        Reboot Required:        Yes (to refresh wireless leases, ethernet leases must be manually renewed)
        Notes:                  DNSMASQ by default sends a single linefeed as a WPAD url.  This can prevent the setting of a WPAD proxy in
                                  certain configurations.   Setting this option to zero prevents sending the empty linfeed WPAD response.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Released:               Update-37B5
        Reboot Required:        No (must restart stubby to activate changes)
        Notes:                  Allows changing the DNSSEC validator used for DoT.  By default, DoT will use its own DNSSEC validation.
                                  This setting allows the user to force dnsmasq DNSSEC validation for DoT servers.

QoS overhead

        Can be set in gui:      Yes
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set qos_overhead=x
                                  (where x = value in bytes, 0-99)
                                  (+ qos_atm value * 100)
                                  (+ qos_mpu value * 1000)


        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Available for MIPS since Update-??
        Reboot Required:        No (must restart QoS)
        Notes:                  Overhead is now interpreted as relative to the
                                IP payload, as per Cake, and corresponding to
                                the GUI values. So overhead for basic Ethernet data
                                is 18 (14 bytes of header and 4 bytes of FCS),
                                not including preamble etc.
                                qos_atm and qos_mpu can be encoded into high
                                order digits to allow GUI to manipulate
                                nvram variable.

QoS minimum packet length

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set qos_mpu=x
                                  (where x = value in bytes, 0-255)


        Routers Supported:      All
        Released:               Update-??
        Reboot Required:        No (must restart QoS)
        Notes:                  Minimum packet length, including overhead. For
                                Ethernet this would be 64, with the overhead
                                being 18. Accounting for preamble would increase
                                both values.

QoS ATM compensation

        Can be set in gui:      No
        Enable via NVRAM:       nvram set qos_atm=x
                                  (where x = 0, no compensation - default, x = 1, atm compensation, x = 2, ptm compensation)

                                Previously ATM compensation was always enabled.
                                PTM compensation is not currently available, and
                                is treated as none, but is allowed for as an
                                NVRAM setting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Disabling the special options:

For options set with 'nvram set variable=1', setting 'nvram set variable=0' will disable
        (nvram commit and reboot if required)

For options set with 'nvram set variable=some_string', setting the with no data 'nvram set variable=',
        will disable (nvram commit and reboot if required)

Alternatively you can erase the variable with 'nvram unset variable' (nvram commit and reboot if required)
